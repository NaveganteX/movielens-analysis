# Collaborative Filtering Applied to MovieLens Data

This repo contains my analysis of the MovieLens 100K dataset with implementations of various collaborative filtering algorithms, including similarity-based methods and matrix factorization methods using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). My analysis is separated into several notebooks. Click on the links below to view each one.
